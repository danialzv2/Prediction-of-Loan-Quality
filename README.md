In this project I predicted the loan risk or quality (loan repayment) by using 'approved' column as target whether the loan is approved or not

There are 3 datasets, loan.csv, payment.csv and clarity_underwriting_variables.csv. All dataset used for the machine learning prediction.
SQL is used to join the dataset into 1 dataframe as training and testing data.

The notebook contains importing dataset, export dataset to database for sql purpose, exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, model training and model evaluation
